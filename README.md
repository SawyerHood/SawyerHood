ðŸ›¸ Sawyer here! I'm a software engineer who is currently exploring all of the weird ways we can interact with LLMs.

I'm currently building all of my experiments in public on [twitter](https://x.com/sawyerhood). 

If you are working on something cool or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me there!
